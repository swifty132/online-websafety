# scam-virus-demo

This is a project for my business and economis class, it covers areas of consumer awareness such as; online scams/fraud, viruses and malware.
On the first page is a few paragraphs about what it is, and what it aims to cover. It also describes how it works, and how to use it.

At the current point in time it doesnt look the best, but the information is there. In the future I hope to pretty it up, and add more features. 

Any questions/concerns can be directed to my email: thesecondswifty@gmail.com, or discord at Swift Stricker#9303.

**THIS IS NOT A VIRUS IN ANY WY SHAPE OR FORM**
