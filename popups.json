If you encounter this should take a picture, close the tab/window, and if the page you were visting is a sketchy one don't revisit it. Send the details of the encounter to https://www.scamwatch.gov.au/report-a-scam or https://www.econsumer.gov/#crnt (if you are outside australia). <br><br> The way this scam works is that someone makes an ad/popup that tricks the target into thinking they have to contact the number and get a problem resolved, the people you call pretend to be from a large company, and will get you to allow them access to your PC claiming it is a 'secure server link' or the sorts. From here they will convince you that you do indeed have the problem and it needs resolving. They may then either 'fix' your PC, charging you upwards of a few hundred dollars, or install malicious content, they may even do both. <br><br> Variations: pretending to be a notification from a service like amazon, your bank, etc (further explained in another question). It may also simply have a link to some software for you to download that will 'clean' your PC but this is actually malicious content itself.
