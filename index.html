      <p>In our everyday life the use of various digital devices, and the internet has become such a vital part of our society, that it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a phone in their pocket. 
        With this rise the need to remain safe online becomes a more preeminent issue. 
        Combined with the increase in online scams and viruses, everyone who uses the internet must know, how to avoid falling for a scam they encountered online. 
        Not only that, but anyone who has a device such as a mobile phone, PC, or laptop. 
        <br><br>
        This website is a free educational resource, that is intended for those who do not know how to remain safe online, or to futher educate those who do. 
        The way it works is that 'popups' or different screens will appear. 
        On the screen will be a prompt, this will consist of a 'title' and a 'description'.
        The title and description should be treated as if they were found on a website by themselves and are based on real scams.
        Below the prompt are two choices, these choices repersent what you would do with the prompt.
        <br><br>
        After you pick a choice the screen will change to the feedback page, this is where you will be told if you picked the correct answer or not.
        It will also inform you more about what the prompt is, the proper course of action one should take, how it works, and different variations of the prompt.
        Once you have read all that you can click 'continue', doing so will take you back to the home page where after a random time between 3 and 10 seconds.
        This is meant to mimic how you may come across these in your day-to-day internet use.
        In order to start the popups click the button above, and once you have cycled through all the prompts the page will notify you so and ask you to reset (this is solely so that you know that you have looped through all the prompts).
        <br><br>
        Please: DO NOT call or attempt to contact ANY of the phone numbers, or contact details listed in the prompts, these are are merely random numbers/details I have made up for the purpose of the prompt.
        This IS NOT legal advice and should not be taken as so, this is just a free educational resource open to all members of the public.
